## General Tips

- Consider both Nested Stacks and Cross-Stack References
- Be aware of how CloudFormation works
- Use Custom Resources to provision custom things
- Consider Terraform and other options for non-AWS resources

Note:
- Nested Stacks and Cross-Stack References have pros and cons, think about how you want to work and how you're organised
- Thinking about how messaging works for nested stacks and replacement updates will help you avoid delays and problems
- Use custom resources judiciously and carefully
- Particularly for non-AWS environments, other options are worth a look, either as an alternative or in a hybrid approach
