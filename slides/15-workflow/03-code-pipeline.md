## The Future... CodePipeline?

AWS CodePipeline supports CloudFormation artifacts as of Nov 2016!

- Automated pipeline through deployment "stages"
- IAM integration
- "Release Change" functionality

Note:
- Only noticed this support as part of prep for this talk
- But looks like just what we need for a more automated and controlled deployment process!
