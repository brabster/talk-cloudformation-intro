## Why?

Why do *you* need something like CloudFormation?

Note:
- With the advent of cloud services, it's easy to create *lots* of infrastructure.
- SBG Intl Data currently has at least 300 different resources defined as part of an environment. They need to be created correctly, securely, in the right order, handle errors during provisioning gracefully, be tidied up when an environment is deleted, etc.
